# Kubernetes and microservice examples for Docker for Windows

Start each example with `start.bat`, each example is stopped with `pause` waiting for key input, after which it should run the `clean.bat`.

The `clean.bat` tries to clean everything, even stuff you might have deployed other means using Kubernetes, so use it only on your own local tests.

**Notice!** Cleaning usually isn't working as wanted, so be prepared to click "Reset Kubernetes Cluster" from the Docker Desktop settings Reset section.
